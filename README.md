# Welcome

Thank you for visiting my code portfolio. I hope you find something of value here.

I’ve been ~~brainwashing~~ programming computers for the past 3 decades and still enjoy it. I've rocked everything from COBOL to C# to LISP to VB to C++ to RISC assembler. It's all fun.

My current focus is primarily Python, working with SQLite and Tkinter, while also maintaining some WordPress, HTML/CSS, and Java projects. Some examples of this work can be found here.

## Hire Me

I’m looking to join or collaborate on commercial enterprises that are fun and challenging (most of them are) and can potentially make the world a better or funner place. I'm one of those can-do people who believes if you can imagine something, we can make it happen, even if we have to create our own tools to do it. I'm happy working on just about anything that keeps my brain busy and love to learn new tools and technologies. I usually pick these up pretty quickly (except perhaps SmallTalk, which is cute, but no ... just, no. LISP or Scheme makes more sense.)

I love working and brainstorming in a team, but also thrive doing my part of the whole autonomously. I'm also Agile-friendly (something I wish they had decades ago).

You can contact me at miki@mikibits.com, or see what I'm up to at https://mikibits.com/codes.
