- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mikibits
- 👀 I’ve been ~~brainwashing~~ programming computers for the past 3 decades and still enjoy it.
  - I've rocked everything from COBOL to C# to LISP to VB to C++ to RISC assembler. It's all fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently getting to know Python, working with SQLite and Tkinter, while also maintaining some WordPress, HTML/CSS and Java projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on commercial enterprises that are fun and challenging (most of them are) and can potentially make the world a better or funner place.
  - I don't think there's a programming language I can't pick up in a hot minute (unless it's SmallTalk, which is cute, but no ... just, no).
- 📫 You can contact me at miki@mikibits.com, or see what I'm up to at https://mikibits.com/codes.
